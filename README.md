# HandDetection
This project uses real time Hand Detection Modul; tracking hands and their landmarks. It can detect at max 2 hands but you can adjust it accordingly. It processes video from webcam and then converts it into RGB format. Similarly, it also display a live FPS counter.
The system uses a two-stage approach: first detecting the palm location, then precisely identifying the hand landmarks
